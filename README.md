# Interactive Visualization Platform  
*A lightweight, browser-based platform to explore and understand different computational and visualization methods interactively.*

---

## Overview  
The **Interactive Visualization Platform** provides an intuitive and visual way to explore various **methods and concepts** through interactive examples and visual cues.  
Itâ€™s designed as a self-learning and exploration tool, simple, accessible, and built to make complex ideas easier to grasp.  

The project focuses on **clarity over complexity**, demonstrating how web technologies can make abstract or data-driven concepts more engaging to interact with.

## Inspiration  
This project began as a personal exploration of how **visual interactivity** can make technical ideas easier to understand.  
I wanted to build something minimal yet meaningful, a small space to experiment with how users can learn through visual feedback rather than long text explanations.  

It also served as a way for me to practice **structuring interactive UIs** with clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  without relying on heavy frameworks.
